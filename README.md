# WinterRush
This is a sliding game where u just need to slide and avoid the obstacles with up and down buttons. This is my first game so don't expect much :)

## Tech stack
- Javascript
- Phaser.js

## Installation
Its super easy to setup this game, bcoz all the required images, fonts, and js libraries are loaded already.

1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/furinehigh/WinterRush.git
```
2. Run the index.html file

You r done, the game is now working on your browser :)

## Why build this?
I wanted to buid smth for the new Siege theme 'Winter' and i didn't wanted to update Koininia again :) bcoz its finished and works smoothly.

## AI usage
I have not used any kind of copilots or agents to build this game, only used chatGPT for debugging and initial setup.
