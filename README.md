# WinterRush
This was a very basic 2D skiing game but now I have transformed it to a good looking 3D skiing game, where you slide the snowman(the skier) within three lanes and avoid the obstacles + can also collect snowballs to increase score much faster.

My best score is 18110, let's see if u can beat me in my own game..:)

## Tech stack
- Next.Js
- React Three
- Three.js

## Features
- Increases difficulty along the way
- Saves best score
- Players can play as long as they want, there is now ending yet :)
- Players can collect snowballs to increase score at a faster rate.
- Added proper sound effects for most of the actions and buttons.
- Added fences + forest surrounding for better game view.
- Proper loading page to load the assets before the game can be played

## Installation
Its super easy to setup this game, bcoz all the required models and sound effects are already in this repo.

1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/furinehigh/WinterRush.git
```
2. Install all the required packages
```bash
npm i
```
2. Run the development mode
```bash
npm run dev
```

You r done, the game is now working at `localhost:3000`

## Why update this?
This was my only project which was not upto the mark so i decided to remake the whole game again...

## AI usage
I have not used any kind of copilots or agents to build this game, only used chatGPT for debugging and initial setup.
